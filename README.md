# Sudoku
A Sudoku Game built with Kivy and Python 3.6

To Do:
Make possible_answers a private variable accesible only via methods in the solver class
Separate solver class and first solver method - Brian Method Solver
Make GUI of board better - room on top, on sides, and on bottom.  So eventually solver can show what it's doing.
Make a second solver - the brute force one I already mostly have programmed.
Dropdown on options for Solver under options window
See if there's a better way to have input boxes coded instead of 700 lines inside kv file
way to get rid of cursor on text inputs?
Figure out deployment
better splash page
